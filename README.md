## Overview 
* Started by making a basic HTML outline of the project:
    * Header 
    * Hero 
    * Main Body 

* Then added styling to the entire page:
    * Header with nav links to take you further into the website
    * Hero image with a floating message in the bottom right corner
    * Then added the three sections as their own individual flex boxes
        * Allowed me to change each section wtih ease

## Problems
* This was extremely challenging. Took alot of knowledge diving in the modules and the web
* Some applications are perfect like the links in my work and the media queries 
    * But I can honestly say I gave it my all and am pleased with the final product
